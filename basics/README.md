# Tutorial: rlberry basics

In this tutorial, we guide you through the following topics:

1. How to create/design GridWorlds to debug your RL agents
    * `A_gridworlds.py`

2. How to implement a value iteration agent with the rlberry interface
    * `B_value_iteration.py`

3. How to evaluate and compare agents during and after training
    * `C_evaluate_and_compare.py`

4. Exercise: implemente your own agent(s) and compare it to value iteration
    * Complete `basics/D_exercise_q_learning.py` by implementing a Q-learning agent (tabular) and compare it to value iteration. You can take inspiration from the script given in step 3. Visualize the evolution of the estimated Q-function using tensorboard.
